"# CumulonimbusWeekGraph" 

A project created to read in the files retrieved each week from the CME's public ftp server. It was built using python 3.6.4, 
utilizing the python libraries matplotlib and tkinter (for the user interface). The .idea folder is included from my editor
(I use the Jetbrains Pycharm environment). The datafiles directory holds example data. Cumulonimbus.py is the actual application 
that can be run, using only the legend_50 image. schedulgrapher.py is a script that takes in and shows **all** of products, rather
than just one at a time.

Cumulonimbus is in version 1.0
